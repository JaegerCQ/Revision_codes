# Revision_codes
The codes provided for revision of SlingBAG      
''sensor_signal_simulation_hand_vessel_kwave.py'' is for hand vessel simulation.  ''liver_phantom_fine_laplacian.ipynb'' demonstrates how to incorporate Laplacian regularization into the SlingBAG iterative algorithm (with no regularization applied during the coarse reconstruction).     
Thank you very much!
